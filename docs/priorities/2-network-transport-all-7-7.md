# 🟡 PRIORITY 2: Network & Transport — ALL DONE (7/7)

### 2.1 — `create_connection` — ✅ DONE

Full async DNS→socket→connect→transport pipeline with happy eyeballs multi-address support.
11 tests pass (basic, send/recv, close, refused, multi-msg, extra_info, missing_args, invalid_factory, lambda, write_eof, is_closing).

**Bugs found & fixed:**
- **Double-decref on `protocol_factory`**: Borrowed reference from `args` was decref'd in `defer` block → segfault in error path. Fixed.
- **`undefined` field cleanup segfault**: `SocketCreationData` fields were `undefined` before initialization, but `errdefer` called `deinitialize_object_fields` which touched them. Fixed by making fields optional/null.
- **Memory leak in result tuples**: `PyTuple_New` result was incref'd by `future_fast_set_result` but never released. Added `defer py_decref(result_tuple)`.
- **Double-close on connected socket**: `defer` in connect callback closed `fd` even on success. Fixed with `fd_created` toggle.
- **Filename typo**: Renamed `create_connnection.zig` to `create_connection.zig`.
- **`is_closing` always False**: `transport_close` didn't set the `closed` flag. Fixed.
- **Intermittent hang in free-threading**: Race condition in `poll_blocking_events` where the loop could block even if callbacks were queued by other threads. Fixed by checking `ready_queue.empty()` before blocking.
- **`Abort` crashes on signals**: `io_uring` operations (submit/poll) were interrupted by signals (EINTR), causing Zig panics or inconsistent returns to Python. Fixed by implementing silent retries on `SignalInterrupt` and removing all remaining `@panic`/`unreachable` calls in the core IO path.
- **GC instability in Subprocess**: `SubprocessTransport` was crashing during GC cycles. Switched to stable manual reference counting and fixed struct initialization to prevent clobbering the Python object head.
